    <p class = "q1"> 1. MY Dashboard uses two barplots (one static and one interactive) and one bar chart to describe the data. </p>
        <p>Q1: For the best selling games for all times, I used static barchart to represent the total global sale for all the games draw out 
        the best 10 of them. 
        The result of graph 1 shows that the best 3 selling games of all times are "Wii Sports", "Super Mario Brothers", and "Mario Kart Wii".</p>
        <p>Q2: I represented the breakdown in each category by region in a pie chart. 
            There are three buttons for each three areas (North Amrica, Europe, and Japan) and one button for global total sale and another one for 
            others. I added the tooltip here with a mouseover hover function so that when the mouse touches the specific part of the pie chart, 
            the tooltip will show the name of the genre and also it's portion within the region. My finding is that: for North America and Europe,
            the most popular genre of the game is "Action", which contsists 20% of regional sales, whereas in Japan, the most populat game genre is "Role-Playing"
            which contsists almost 30% of the regional sale.  </p>
        <p>Q3: I used bar plot again because it gives out the most direct information. In this graph, I also added a select drop down button which 
            allow users to select from all 12 kinds of categories. I decide the measure the publisher by their total sale in a genre, because 
            higher total sales are likely to indicate the capability of the publisher (they can be very experienced i.e. old in publishing certain genra
            of games or they can be very successful at only a few games). We can see clearly the total_sales of each publisher in each genre and decide 
            which publisher are better. For example, "Nintendo" is the best publisher for puzzle game, it has a way higher total sale than others, and it's also
            the best for Strategy, Adventure, Misc, Platform, Role-Playing.

    <p> 2. 3 reasons why D3 is helpful: (1) It allows the users to interact with the graph to see what happens with different data sets.
        Users can change data set by clicking on buttons or selecting options which and the same graph wil modify accordingly to the new data,
        which gives the user a direct comparison. (2) D3 enables many types of graphs. Not only the basic bar/pie chart, but also violin, density,
        correlation, spider/radar and even geographic map. All these helps to analyze one dataset from more perspectives and dimentions, so
        the user can make the most out of the informaiton from the data. (3) D3 also allows us to perform statistical tests.
        It can be helpful when combined with statistics, such as t test and regressions with scatter plot. When calculating the regression, for example
        the best fit-line and the data can be compared side by side.</p>

    <p>
        3. 3 reasons why D3 may not be the best visualization tool: (1) D3 requires the users to know what to do with the data. As opposed to
        excel or STATA, which does the chart and regression automatically for the users when the data is inputed, D3 requires the user to hand draw
        the rectangles for the bar chart and the circle for pie chart. So it can be confusing when the user don't know what to do with the data. 
        (2) There aren't many built-in stats tests portion for D3. So it is not easy to calculate the statistical values such as "R^2" or perform
        a t-test/f-test. (3) Because D3 works more with the DOM and on decoration of the graphs, less with the data itself, users may not get a deep
        understanding of the data and how it is visualized.

        4.Evaluate the accessbility. Overall, my dashboard is easy to read and conveys sufficient information. According to the reading 
        "A comprehensive guide to Acessible Data Visualization", I've made sure that my graph doesn't include colors that are not friendly to 
        color blind people (I avoided uising green and red and blue and for most part used purple). Secondly, I've made sure that all my graphs
        have labels for both axis and a legend for pie-chart, theyfore others can know what I was talking about. Thirdly, in order to make the graphs
        clearer, i've added paddings in all of them. This separaetes each data groups clearer (especially in pir chart). Lastly, to be more 
        assisstive, I used a select drop down button instead of manual string input box for users to select the genere they want to search 
        for the best publisher and also buttons for users to select which regional breakdown they want to see(just in case they don'e know 
        how many regions there are). All these may be helpful for color-blind users, and usrs who do not have many knowledge on the data, 
        because the button and selection options are more convenient. However, it may not be accessible for people who are iliterate (doesn't 
        know what the button means) and also who are specifially color blind to purple. Also, my pie chart is of 12 colors and maybe will cause 
        confusions for some color-blind people. In order to improve, I can use other representation, such as density/spider graphs.
    </p>

        5. When I was implementing the pie-chart, there are in total 12 genre so the pie chart will be at least divided into 12 parts.
        If I were to include different colors for each genre, the accessbility will very likely decrease for color-blind people if there 
        are these many colors. However, after I looked at all the possible charts, pie chart is the most direct way to represent breakdowns 
        of a whole. Therefore I did not change the graph. Also, I could also add the string to pie-chart directly besides the legend for better
        redability, but I thought I can just add a tooltip so that mouseover will show the genre and percentage and it is also a good way to clearify
        the graph
